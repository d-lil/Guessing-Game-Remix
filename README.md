  Once you click "BEGIN" you will be brought to the first question where you select from a multiple-choice list to answer the question.

  * NOTE: Once the quiz begins- a timer begins counting down in the top-right hand side of the screen that ends the quiz if it hits zero. If you get a question wrong you will also be penalized.
